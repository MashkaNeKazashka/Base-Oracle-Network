Base Oracle Network

📋 Project Description

Base Oracle Network is a decentralized oracle network that provides reliable and secure price feeds and data services for DeFi applications on the Base network. The network aggregates data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and prevent manipulation.

🔧 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Solidity 0.8.0
Framework: Hardhat
Network: Base Network
Standards: ERC-20
Libraries: OpenZeppelin, Chainlink

🛠️ Smart Contract Functions
Core Functions:
reportPrice(string assetPair, uint256 price, uint256 confidence) - Report price data
requestData(string assetPair) - Request data from oracle network
getPrice(string assetPair) - Get latest price for asset pair
registerOracle(address oracleAddress, string nodeUrl) - Register new oracle node
verifyData(string assetPair, uint256 timestamp, uint256 price) - Verify data integrity
updateOracleStake(address oracleAddress, uint256 newStake) - Update oracle stake
Events:
PriceReported - Emitted when price is reported
DataRequested - Emitted when data is requested
OracleRegistered - Emitted when oracle is registered
PriceVerified - Emitted when price is verified
StakeUpdated - Emitted when oracle stake is updated

🔒 Security Considerations
Security Measures:
Multi-Source Verification - Data verification from multiple sources
Reentrancy Protection - Using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
Access Control - Role-based access control for oracle nodes
Data Integrity - Cryptographic verification of data
Emergency Pause - Emergency pause mechanism for security issues
Stake-Based Security - Oracle stake requirements for reliability
Audit Status:
Initial security audit completed
Formal verification in progress
Community review underway
